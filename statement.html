  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My name is Jedd Panopio. I am currently a Digital Media Art Major student at San Jose State University. As a beginning artist, I love working with concepts and ideas that I am familiar with.However, I do like challenging myself from time to time on ideas and concepts to further open my mind and come out of my comfort zone. I mainly base my projects on my personal experiences or media that I love such as video games and film and anime.

</p>
  <p>My work consist of mainly digital media art. Some projects I have done are video art, sound art and code art to name a few. I am still new to digital media art and its concepts but I think it is interesting and something I have enjoyed doing. For my projects I mainly use Adobe software, such as Photoshop and Premiere. In terms of my processes, I try to find and research other artists of the particular medium and try to gain inspiration from the examples I find. Since I am new to digital media, I create these projects because I am interested in gaining new knowledge about the software I use and how I can push my projects to the limit with what I know.
